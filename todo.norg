* TODO
 ** Name Binders
    - the `NameE` constuctor from `data Exp e` must not be accessible as out of a lambda context it has no meaning

 ** Type checking
    - use an enumeration for the error instead of String. It would allow for more specific error messages produced by the interpreter itself



    - for recursion create a withRecVariable that provide a recE
